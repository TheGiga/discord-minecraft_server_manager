# Minecraft Server Manager Bot
Discord bot that lets you run dockerized minecraft servers.
*NOTE: You must host it yourself, for now at least.*

It is using [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server).

# You can:
- [x] Configure server properties (inside of `/start` command)
- [x] Run multiple Java Edition versions. (I tested from 1.19.3 to 1.7.10)
- [x] Upload/Download world(s) to/from server.
- [x] Fully use server console in a discord text channel.

# You can't (but its planned ~~somewhat~~)
- [ ] Run multiple server(s) at once.
- [ ] Upload plugins
- [ ] Make `/start` templates.


# Configurable
You can configure most of the stuff, just change variables in `config.py` file to your desired ones.
There is more info on what's what in the file.
